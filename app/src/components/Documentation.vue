        Be prepared to calculate some basic checksums. Colored buttons blink in
        specific pattern. To disarm the module you should press the button of
        correct color matching the pattern.

      <p class="mt-2">
        Each colored button has respective number assigned. To calculate the
        number of the correct answer You should sum all the color numbers which
        blinked and then find the remainder of a division by number of colors
        (Modulo).
